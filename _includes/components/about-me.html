<p>
    I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and conducting research in the <b>field of mobile app ecosystem</b> under the mentorship of <a href="https://csc.lsu.edu/~mahmoud/" target="_blank">Dr. Anas Mahmoud</a>. My research projects involve applying state-of-the-art <b>natural language processing techniques (NLP), machine learning</b>, and <b>qualitative analysis</b>. I build research-driven systems that assist users in making app-related decisions and evaluate them using <b>prototyping</b> and <b>statistical analysis</b>. Currently, I am investigating <b>mobile app interface design</b> strategies that rely on cognitive biases and impact end-users negatively. My ultimate <b class="about-me-goals">research goal</b> is to <b class="about-me-goals">enhance user experiences (UX)</b> within mobile apps and <b class="about-me-goals">assist users in their app-related decisions</b> (e.g. app install, leave an informative review).
