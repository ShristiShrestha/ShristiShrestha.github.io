    <p style="border-left: 3px solid black; background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 12px; border-radius: 0 4px 4px 0;">
    I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="https://csc.lsu.edu/~mahmoud/" target="_blank">Dr. Anas Mahmoud</a>. My research focuses on the applications of Large Language Models to address the needs of mobile application (app) users and developers. I apply natural language processing (NLP), qualitative analysis, and statistical methods to extract insights from user reviews and app design practices. I also investigate app store policies on app testing & review and conduct user studies to examine their impact on app developers. So far, our research team has proposed and empirically evaluated AI-driven design strategies to enhance mobile app store utility. We have also proposed several actionable strategies to effectively implement app store policies on app testing and feature requirements.
