OLED iPhone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have been out since 2017, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Currently you can only use dark for widgets with automatic switching between light and dark. You can manually set it up black the widget but only without automatic switching between light. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense to have a black widget on your Home Screen when the rest of the icons/widgets are light. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll adjust to 5 star once added but I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a reason this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already an option.

Too many times I miss events because Fantastical inexplicably disconnects with a calendar (I have two Microsoft accounts and one Google account). \n\nFantastical never warns that it has disconnected you from one of your calendars, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the default calendar for events. It just quietly adds those new events to whatever calendar it chooses. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even though the missing calendar is still enabled in your Accounts setting.\n\nAny advantages Fantastical may have are obviated by these integration bugs. None of us can afford to miss events. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always have to worry if Fantastical is still properly connected to all of your calendar accounts. And when it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, even if you catch it before you miss something, then play to set aside some time to reconnect it. And then wait for it to disconnect again, without warning. It always does.",

Integration is also great, and everything works wonderfully across iPad, iPhone, and macOS (both laptops and big-screen mac minis).  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotta be tough to make the UI work across all these different screen sizes, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really done a great job at that.

        "content": "UPDATE.  Fantastical is still the best but\nI also use my other calendar app 24me still because it has live links for tasks in the pop-up notifications - so I can take action like make the phone call, send e-mail, etc. directly from the notification pop-up window or within the calendar app. And for the notes that use basic word process and images.  \n\nFantastical is my go-to, day to day, hard working, heavy lifter.  \n\nOriginal review:\n\nI have 1000s of apps and I beta test several.  This app is so useful and user friendly!  I had a heavy favorite, paid upgrade, calendar/task app but I've switched over to Fantastical 2.  Most important in this choice is a large Watch Complication that shows BOTH the next Event or Task, almost all others only show events - useless.  Easy to use Watch app.  \n\nBeyond the many powerful features, I love that the phone interface has a full month view with dynamic corresponding details listed below - one view without the other isn't useful.  Great navigation. \n\nOnce you learn the super simple way to enter details with creating an Event it's a blast!  No need to mess with settings, just write in Event, date, etc, in a sentence and it's done.  Watch the brief video here in the App desc.  AWESOME\n\nIt's great to be able to choose which apps I want the map links and browser links to open with.  All the browsers on my phone are available.  Wow!  Big plus, don't have to use Apple maps.  (Hate Apple Maps and had deleted it but many apps can only use Apple Maps).\n\nFantastical 2 is extremely well designed and maintained.  Great (fast) sync with the Watch Compl. and in general with all other tasks, reminders, and  calendars I have.  Powerful and stable.  Reliable. And just cool to use.  \n\nCreating Reminders from e-mail would be handy.  My other app is cross platform - Android etc. but no Mac OS. But those are not deal or star rate breakers.\n\nGot the iPad app. A very rare purchase for me to pay separately for iOS.  I want to support great work.  I can't afford the Mac OS app. I'm confident it's excellent too.\n\nThanks for a great app!!",

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never hear this default alert sound before and I still have my own alert sound set in iOS calendar alert settings.

Downloaded the app and realized the insane subscription fee and immediately uninstalled.  Did not even try the trial. This developer should be investigated for price gouging. And the amazing part based on the reviews people pay it!",

At the time, I said that the app is a dear favorite of mine on other Apple platforms and I saw the potential in this but there were a few key issues that stopped me from using it constantly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \n\nSince then, things have dramatically improved. Seemingly weekly a new update pops up in the App Store for this app with an EXTENSIVE change log. Every bug that I found in March have been addressed. The small ones that I find are addressed almost as soon as I find them. The clean interface, the scalability in my space is everything I ever dreamed of for program management. \n\nKeep up the great work, Fantastical team. I will be happily keeping my yearly subscription on auto-renew. \u011f\u0178\u2014\u201c\u00ef\u00b8\ufffd\u011f\u0178\u00a7\u00a1",

(For example, any event that had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christmas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the title would end up on Christmas Day, whether or not that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when I actually meant for the Church Christmas Dinner or Family Christmas Party or Christmas Concert to be.) It drives me bonkers and honestly has messed up some important appointments without me noticing. BUT I did not find anything that displayed my calendar in a better way. Other calendar apps are seriously lacking compared to this one. It really is a fantastic calendar app in almost every way. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read in forums that fantastical is so proud of their language processing, considering it to be their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most important feature,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but I wish they would recognize that many users would prefer to have an option to TURN IT OFF. I 100% don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want it. (I know I can use quotes to work around it, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not ideal to me.) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my two cents!",

It just randomly assigns the time to the name or the duration to the time. It takes longer to correct than just entering it the old fashioned way. The location rarely works because their maps only show about one out ten places.  There is no reasonable month view on any device. \n\nIf you subscribe, make sure you do it through Apple. If you subscribe from the flexibits like I did, it is an hidden cancellation process that is not easy to find.",

        "title": "Almost perfect",
        "content": "Update 04.03.24:\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried fantastical for a few weeks now side by side with a couple other apps, and as much as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one I keep going towards, I have three dealbreakers which are going to make me walk away from it at the end of the trial:\n\n1. iOS specific- the inability to see your calendar and tasks in the same view. It may as well be two apps. I have used two other apps, one allows a drag and drop method from a task list to the calendar, and the other one brings up a mini calendar and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to select a slot. If either of these was built in, it would solve this issue. macOS Desktop app works perfectly!  \n\n2: For both macOS and iOS - a lot of people rave about calendar sets, to me they are useless. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying get rid of the feature because I can see why people love them, but I need something that allows you to be a quick shortcut between the calendar view, and the settings view to toggle shared calendars on and off. If only there was a one button shortcut to go to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153settings > calendar & lists\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this would literally solve my issue. \n\nThere are other things I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like, but they are not real breakers, unfortunately, these two are. Due to these two, the two things I use the most on my calendar, I have to let this app to, which is sad because it does everything else better than almost every other app out there.  \n\nOriginal:\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been looking for an all in one calendar/task manager. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried a handful and vowed that fantastical wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut it, but, it is the app I just keep going back to. A lot of people have complained about the change to subscription, it honestly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me much and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all for supporting an app that makes my life easier to balance. But, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not perfect, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what would make it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to me. 1. It looks like it was built in 2015. It just looks d to me. I saw a video of it on Vision Pro, I would LOVE to see that UI on the iOS and desktop apps. 2. Specific to iOS: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pain to manage tasks on the calendar. Other apps have a drag and drop on iOS, or a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button that shows you the calendar view to select the slot you want to drop the task in. With fantastical on iOS, you have to memorize the slot and then save it, if you got it wrong you can move it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just extra steps. 3. Calendar groups/sets are absolutely pointless to me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather they have an easy way to toggle shared calendars on and off. Pretty much all other apps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried have it this way except for Fantastical. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d swap out easy switches for sets literally any day of the week. 4. Calendar availability: I would like it to be more like Google calendar UX where I can look up the person and see the availability vs trying to schedule a meeting first and then checking. This is the only reason I keep going back to google calendar, you implement this I can stop going to the website. 5. Specific to iOS: widgets, there are many, but all too crowded or too big. There is one where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with weather and events and takes. If \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was swapped with the actual calendar date, it would be perfect. Other than that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one calendar I keep going back to. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it would take, but any (or all) the above that you could implement would make this person a very happy customer.",

I have used this for over a year, definitely worth paying the subscription. If you pay the subscription on Flexbits the developer you also get to use their app for contacts which is really well designed as well. I like how you can connect with your other calendar accounts. Such as Google, Apple, Outlook. And you can mark appointments in different colors. Fantastical is the preferred calendar I use on display screen widget on my iPhone. Definitely a great buy!",

The current issue is that all of a sudden, when I have reminders pop up for multiple tasks, when I haptic press one to snooze it, that task snoozes but the others just go away and stop reminding me even though they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t snoozed. This makes the task reminders basically unusable for me. Extremely frustrating. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more stars at this time because of this issue. Usually it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 4 star app unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being buggy, and then it loses starts because the problems are significant when they occur.",

        "content": "I really like this app. I love the convenience of bringing calendar events and reminders to one widget. I love that it works natively and that I can tell Siri to add something it syncs with iCloud natively and add it to the Fantastical. The problem I have with this is that as many other users have expressed the lack of background refresh is very present. For example, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sitting here by my MacBook right now I have my Fantastical widget my Reminders widget for iOS and if I tell Siri to add a reminder, it shows up on my iOS widget, and about 10 seconds later, it stinks on the iOS widget for Fantastical but it will not sync on the opposing device unless I physically open it for example if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on my MacBook and I add it, it will show up but I have to manually open the app on my iPhone to get it to update and show that information on the iOS widget I feel like for the price of things like this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be an issue especially considering that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve came across threads on Reddit complaining about this three years ago. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how a developer can expect people to pay $60 a year and have issues that are ongoing for this type of timeframe let alone at all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty disappointing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the developer will tell me that I need to do this or do that, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty diverse in the tech industry. I have my iCloud calendar turned on along with reminders. I have background refresh enabled, and I also added my iCloud account to Fantastical and signed in with the generic passkey from iCloud so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a user it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply just bad developing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going on for over three years.

It provides me with flexibility and ease to create events and sync across calendars. My favorite view is month with a list of upcoming events shown below. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t found anything close or comparable and other free calendar apps are more simple than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m using the free version of Fantastical and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still pretty powerful. \n\nNow that Fantastical has a monthly subscription fee, I might sign up again. (Yearly is cheaper but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shell out all that money at once.) I will look at their updated premium features. This is the best iPhone calendar app (beats native calendar for me) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever used and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably will stick with it for a long time.",

Calendar 366, Riddle Calendar, apple calendar are really good, free, or a tiny fraction of Fantastical subscription price. \u011f\u0178\u02dc\ufffd",

        "content": "Normally I recommend fantastical to anyone using a calendar app, but a bunch of weird stuff has been happening the last year or two with this app.\n\nOverall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great and functions well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to find something that works as well with natural language. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great and makes adding events super easy.\n\nIn terms of annoying stuff. I had a super frustrating sync issue for a few months sometime last year that I managed to resolve, but took literally days of emailing and hours of work to fix. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m spending money on stuff, I like for it to work, and that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case and it drove me insane. It eventually worked and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great result, but it cost me money and time.\n\nRecently they updated the widgets available and removed the week + events list I liked to use and replaced it with a month view. It made no sense to me and so now I just have events, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not very useful. Weekly context is more relevant to me than monthly if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m seeing weekly events below. Seems obvious to me, but they changed it to be a month view which is just noise to me.\n\nOverall, like I said\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to lie and say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not looking for alternatives, because at this point I am. I want a great app that works well and functions as expected. Not something that breaks and I need to fix, or changes, and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revert. Those things are why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m at 3/5 stars.",

It was always overpriced, but the subscription model is silly at the point especially since I still have to use Google calendar for many things LIKE editing a calendar invitation without sending a notice to everyone in your meeting that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an edit. Between Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, their awesome recent revamps - a yearly $60 subscription to a calendar is ludicrous. Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there better things you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather do with your money?",

Why?!!!\n\nAt least you still have that Lock Screen widget, that displays the current week in the middle of three rows with the previous and next weeks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wednesday Sept 27 as I write this, and I really love how I can see the entire first week of October on the bottom row of the widget.

This is a very frustrating an unnecessary feature that often creates major problems. If I select October 1 and create a new event, I do not want or need that date to be changed automatically. This feature actively sabotages a basic scheduling task. 2) Time zone shift. This is an embarrassing disaster. If you travel outside your timezone, all of your event times will shift automatically and create massive confusion. 3) Start/end time shifts. If an all-day event is multiple days long and you change the start day, the entire event will be shifted automatically instead of just the start day that you are changing. This, again, creates confusion and incorrect scheduling if you do not happen to double check every setting after making the specific adjustment. 4) Same problem with start and end times. Changing the start time of any event will automatically change the end time. It is exhausting trying to quickly schedule events when making a single adjustment results in silent, automatic changes elsewhere. I have to stop using this app because it has burned me too many times in too many various ways.",

        "content": "Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great app! Especially if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re managing multiple calendars. However, the event creation flow is not great. I use this to view my calendar but I avoid creating new events in it because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frustrating and difficult. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rate the app 5 stars if the event creation flow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such a frustrating experience because everything else is great. \n\nThe event entry screen is meant to be convenient and encourage natural language parsing, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overly aggressive and almost always requires me to expand and type things manually. Anytime you type \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in an event name, it just drops those names when creating the event because it assumes they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re invitees\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 with\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 plain text names.\n\nFurther, time entry is awful and require perfect dexterity. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. So. Bad. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually less space than if you were to enter the time with the iPhone keyboard directly: the numbers and formatting characters are RIGHT next to each other with no space so most of the time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m making a typo. Endlessly infuriating. \n\nAnd then! After I enter an event! It snaps the calendar view back to today. WHO. DID. THIS?????? I have such a hard time with this. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a parent and I have to enter stuff for my kids - like soccer games - in bulk at once. The snap back after adding EACH event has made it so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize Fantastical parsed something wrong (as usual). And, because I have ADHD, I of course forgot tiny details and now have to scroll around my calendar to try and remember which thing I just inputted and by the time I find it, I forget the corrections.\n\nAnd for all of the smart, natural language processing with event names, it has still never managed to figure out how to invite real people from names, even if I have a contact card or they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in my email contacts. I invite the same handful of people to events and have to type it in manually every single time. \n\nIn summary:\n- wow event creation screen really wants you to do things one way and that one way actually messes up most of the time \n- wow entering event times is a horribly restricted amount of space  \n- wow snap back to today after creating new events actively makes using this calendar hard \n- but viewing multiple calendars is great\n\nMaybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time I investigate alternatives \u011f\u0178\u02dc\ufffd",

The pricing is way too high, there are clearly obtrusive buttons prompting an already paying user to upgrade, and the new app ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT have all the same features for existing Fantastical 2 users no matter how much they try to gloss over this. They say oh no it's the same features, you just have to hand over your information, add all your calendars to our *free* account... yeah did I have to do that before? No? Then it's not the same features... This isn't a matter of \"I don't like how the new version looks\". People can disagree on preferences.

Then to top off the frustrations with the app, it is now increasing in price, not just a couple dollars but $39.99 to $56.99.
