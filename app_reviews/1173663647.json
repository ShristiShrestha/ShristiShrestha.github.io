I like that I can have color coded separate categories (family, work, social, medical, volunteer, subscriptions, homemaintenance, etc) and also add google calendars.  Many calendars do this.  My favorite feature is that you can set how many weeks to see at a time (in month view) AND the borders between months do not have special status.  I usually show six weeks at a time starting with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s week.  I can scroll forward (or back) by week, not just by month.  Makes planning so much easier what I can frame the events I am focusing on, even if the don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all occur in the same calendar month.  Support is great too!",

While I was able to get the iCloud calendars working with a little bit of hassle, I learned from the developers website that I was not allowed to sync my iCloud reminders to apples decision to no longer support CalDav. I'm a bit confused by this. If the developers are not able to integrate peoples' iCloud reminders into BusyCal, why is it that apps such as Fantastical can easily integrate iCloud Reminders?",

It works right out of the proverbiael box and is mosly self-explanatory. Take a look at the settings and, In time, you'll want to tweak it to your liking: connect with other calendars and manage tasks, for example. You don't even need to open Calendar and Reminders, perhaps just for the comfort of verifying data in either.\n\nBusyCal jas replaced Fantastical and OmniFocus, simplifying my life tremendously.",

I'm on the bandwagon now. It has helped me organize, streamline, simplify my calendars--centralizing things and being able to spend less time reorganizing things. I think there are a few minor wishes (can't send emails without MacOS \"Mail\" opening despite this not being my OS default app which is Gmail on Chrome, missing native Google Workspace features like seeing Google Calendar resources or invitees schedules, more granular control of tasks prioritization) but these don't stop me from giving this a 5 over a 4 (4.5 would've been my choice if it was possible). I installed this on my phone and feel the same. I still might use Google for some situations (like above) but I usually start from BusyCal and take over elsewhere for anything that needs native features. Hopefully, the devs behind this will find wasy to tap in to those features or maybe make their own solution.

        "content": "In many ways, I love BusyCal.  But now that I am retired (fewer appointments)  work on a laptop almost all the time, I find that the displays for a day or a week display a lot of empty space.  I've tried list view, which eliminates the empty space but doesn't offer a visual organization of my week.  Wish there were a way to get a better display that somehow compromises between the traditional display and the listview, compact but structured.",

Loved the display, weather integration, colors, agenda etc. Until the delay in synching to my Google calendars became a problem. It is not instantaneous, and the \"5-min push\" is glitchy. At one point, BusyCal was still showing the original time for an appointment I had already changed in Google and it caused a bit of a panic. I restarted the app and it was still showing the old time. Then I input a few test entries and unfortunately the synching was still a disappointment.\n\nAnd so the search for the perfect mac calendar app continues!",

For I don't know why, we drifted away from all that (probably spoke face-to-face, go figure) and I started using Fantastical.  Works great as well.  But, as many other software developers, a shift to subscription pricing was decided.  And, well, as much as it makes sense at some level, it makes no sense if you consider the user.  I buy a computer that is at least $1000.  Then, I end up having to pay 200/300/400 per month to use wonderful software products.  That is simply crazy.  So, I went looking for a solution.  And then I remembered - BusyCal.  Works wonderfully.  Puts all my calendars in a single place (I work at three institutions) plus my personal calendar and the wife's calendar.  And, we are using it.  Wonderful tool.  Easy to use and set up.  Have it on the Mac, iPad and iPhone.  Good luck everyone!",

Love the color coding options, the coordinating todo options, the flexibility of the users choice to show this or that list and not show another.  Very well planned, maintained, and a long time standard for me on my macbook pro!   I've tried others..... none compare.\n\nOnly addition I'd like to see is a user \"NOTES\" page along side of (or 1 click away ) where a user can write long details of the day, events, add pictures or files attached to the date but on a separate full page per day.  It would function somewhat like where they allow you to put \"notes\" at the end of each event, journal, banner, todo, or timed todo, but would provide you a dedicated space for each day (although you wouldn't have to write on each day .....so just a daily template available you could click to bring up) where you put other things happening that won't fit on the little squares of monthly calendar boxes.   BTW  I know you can type on the daily page, but it' s not geared to journaling or recording events and the details or adding pictures, files  or memories  for the day. \n\nOverall, I'd give them 10 stars for the functionality, reliability, fast email customer service requests, color coding, syncing !!!  PERFECT SYNCING!! and the daily view which I find very helpful...like a timeline.  Keep up the good work guys!",

        "content": "I have tried lots of task management apps over the years. Since I prefer to keep my calendar and tasks together, Informant 5 and Fantastical have been my favorites over other popular apps like Omni Focus and Things. I liked Informant 5 because it was a pretty robust task manager; I like Fantastical because I could just drag items from the todo list on to relevant days of the week. BusyCal offers me the best of both of those worlds. Like Fantastical, BusyCal uses the native Apple Reminders which can then be dragged to, and moved around on the calendar. But much to my delight, BusyCal ADDS to Apple Reminders with tags, filters, and more that turn Apple Reminders into a pretty powerful task management system for me. I also like that I can add graphics, stickies, and journal entries to different days. This past year, I also began using the new Notion.so app for notes, files etc, which makes it pretty slick to simply add a URL to access all of the rest of my work on a project. Conversely, I can highlight something in Notion.so and use the Apple share sheet to add it to Apple Reminders and get a new todo item from my notes into BusyCal. So, I honestly think BusyCal is the best solution I've found, yet, for managing tasks and calendar together. Thank you!",

Some calendar apps I've tried took far too long to load. This meant I couldn't add or change something unless the program was already running. Having to wait took me out of the moment and broke my flow. BusyCal doesn't have this problem.\n\nMy calendar is always available. BusyCal puts an icon in the menu bar. Other programs have done this, but the program had to be running in the background for the menu bar icon to be available. The BusyCal menubar icon is ALWAYS there whether or not the program is running, so I can see my schedule whenever I want and can enter things on the fly. \n\nFinally, I really like BusyCal's monthly view. It lets me see up to 12 weeks at a time and can scroll indefinitely.\n\nUsing BusyCal, I feel like I'm interacting with my schedule, not my calendar program.",

The same calendar in Outlook renders smoothly (60fps).\nI have a lot of repeated meetings, I have found online that for more then 200 reps the devs recommend splitting them up - none of mine are above 200 though (they are either infinite or about 20 reps).

And uncomplicated is what I need when it comes to throwing appointments at my devices.

BusyCal 3 offers compliance with upcoming requirements of Google calendars in particular so it is necessary to switch to this from BusyCal 2 if you\u2019d like top view a Google calendar with the application.\n\nThe problem my business has with BusyCal 3 is that the interface has been \u2018updated\u2019 to a more \u2018flat\u2019 design I would guess to more closely match an Apple or Google calendar web view. This is not a good thing as it\u2019s harder on the eyes to figure out what\u2019s going on if you have a complex situation with multiple calendars, such as a business with a dozen users. The banners across the top can be switched back to \u2018classic\u2019 view giving the familiar one pixel border that helps distinguish one banner event from the other. This classic option is not available for calendar events themselves, however, and that is really too bad. PLEASE PROVIDE CLASSIC VIEW FOR CALENDAR EVENTS for increased functionality. Our business switched to BusyCal 2 because of the UI changes in Apple\u2019s Calendar, and now BusyCal 3 is mimicking that flawed product.\n\nThe other interface problem is that the highlight color for the current time and the current day has switched from a sedate blue to a distractingly garish vivid purple color (as seen in the screenshot above), irregardless of your selection for highlight color made in System Preferences > Appearance > Highlight color. No good; too distracting, too much visual impact. Dial it back. What were you thinking? Why not add functionality so that users can pick their own color, or provide a more neutral color. Also, the dock icon of BusyCal2 showed a neutral grid when the application was not active, and the day\u2019s actual date when it was active. This functionality is lost on this version as it always shows \u2018May 27\u2019 when the application is not active, losing the quick visual cue to let you know that the app is not running. Bad interface design decisions all the way around here.\n\nIn regards to the developer response: I appreciate that you have taken the time to share some words, but they do not actually address my issues. Your response re: the garish purple highlight is flatly wrong, and your other suggestions do not address the fundamental critique of your downgrades to the interface (although they claim to be solutions). Therefore I am lowering your rating from 2 stars to 1 because I cannot abide a response that attempts to disingenuously blunt the force of my review with obfuscation.",

Admittedly it does show the name of the month in a super-small font but for years I\u2019ve grown accustomed to only having to quickly glance down at my dock to get the date.  And I limit the number of open programs running in the background.\n\nIt\u2019s a minor issue that cost a star but I would still recommend the program.",

Who knows is the upgrades will fix the issues or not. I wish I had not spent the money and just kept using the older version. Nothing gained.",
