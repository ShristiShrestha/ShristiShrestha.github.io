        "content": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big fan of this app! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used it for my dog-sitting career for almost 2 years now. I like the way it looks compared to the apple calendar app which is NOT friendly for my dog-sitting needs as I need to see whole months in retrospect and not just a little bubble underneath individual dates\n\nUnfortunately this week it moved a lot of my dog-sitting trips to wrong days and times. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what happened but thank god I had a lot of my trips memorized, but because of the Calendar being buggy, i messed up on one of my dog-sitting trips because the calendar had moved it to the next day. Some dates had been moved to different hours, some different days. At first I thought I had written the dates wrong but it happened with so many of them I knew it wasn't a coincidence. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been using this app for years and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had this problem. However this makes me a little bit more wary using Minical moving forward, make sure you have another calendar possibly or a way of making sure your dates aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to glitch out. \n\nalso some quality of life features that would be nice\n- an option to keep the past months from the calendar when the months are over. I hate that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my whole year saved in the calendar and it deletes past months. Make\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing things like my taxes harder because I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep track of how much I worked certain months. \n- the way the 1st of the month starts can be glitchy. Sometimes it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up on the month, the month starts on the 2nd, and in order to see the 1st you need to go back a month. \n- I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found when a month is full the app can behave a little glitchy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whats happening to me currently and I implore someone to take a look at it.",

        "content": "I really do love this app. I like that it integrates with Google Calendar very easily. My favorite thing about this app is all the widgets I can apply to my home screen on my iPad or my phone and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so many options to view my schedule. My favorite is I can view my schedule, In a week or three days or current/past/ future month or a running 4 week calendar that shows current week with next four week. Way more to love than google calendar. I do wish they could incorporate list view of calendar and be able to make the font size smaller to view my schedule the whole week instead of just 4 days. Also feel like this would do well with scheduling a list to do (would make it extra special)",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rare I pay for the premium version of an app right away, but I was so impressed within the first 5 minutes of using this one that I went ahead and bought pro. My only minor issues are that I wish we could color code birthdays, and also that more fonts could be added as a few of them look very similar.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love the ads, but understand why the company needs them. I also love that the upgrade is a one time fee/purchase, so I will be upgrading in the near future! For those not interested in paying, ads only appear if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the app open for a minute, instead of being in your face the second you open it, which I appreciate. I love how easy it is to customize your calendar, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one place I feel like I actively use one.

This is worth a look for anyone who lives by their calendar!\n\nI have two wishes that would make it perfect in my mind:\n\n1. I wish that if you were to swipe left or right on the schedule part it would advance by one day in the appropriately direction. Right now, it is somewhat jarring that when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a schedule for a Tuesday in the middle of the February and you swipe to go to the next day, you end up on March 1.\n\n2. I wish there were some way, even if it were just a brief view, to be able to see a day schedule that shows open spaces. Sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just difficult to know where you have openings when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only looking at it in a scheduled view. To have this option would mean I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any other calendar at all.",

For me, I think it is not necessary to see this text from the notifications, please delete it, it just show \"1 event tomorrow - Interview, work, task, etc \" \u00e2\u0153\u00a6 And 2 Add a new option to write \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new task\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by turning off the minutes notification.

        "content": "I wish to thank the developer so very much for fixing the location address issue. I am very appreciative of the quick response and of your hard work. Again, thank you. Minical is a 5 star app!\n\nPrevious review: At some point during a recent update, Minical started parsing (perhaps this is not the correct word) US addresses differently than earlier versions. Previously US addresses were brought into the location field in an event, and they were ordered correctly. Now, however, the Zip code is inserted between the place/business name and the street address. Why the change that causes this? I find this both odd and annoying. Hence the loss of 2 stars. Old review: Minical is absolutely the best calendar app for iOS that I have used. Everything about this app is clearly laid out and works efficiently. The search function is fantastic. I have spent more time and money than one should in search of an easy to use and straightforward calendar app. Finally, I have found just such an app in Minical. In fairness to those reading this review, I did take the plunge and paid for the upgrade to the pro version. I have no regrets that I did. Recommended without hesitation.",

        "content": "Until I tried minical. I am obviously sad after switching to iPhone because the widgets are not interactable like in android. I also miss having full screen calendar widgets like on android. This is the closest I can get to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153month\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on android which displayed an entire screen widget of the current month. Obviously on android you could flip through the months and add events from the widget itself, but the best part was just being able to see the entire month with events at a glance. Not seeing which days had events and having to click in. Minical is limited because Apple hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accepted full screen size widgets but once they do, it will be amazing and I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to click in to see days with multiple events that get cut off on the widget. Month on android also had way more customization and it was fun to match it with my wallpaper, but Minical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s  retro scheme is awesome so I got pro for that (and to get rid of ads). And I also got pro to get rid of ads because I found myself using it as my calendar, not just as a widget. I think Minical is onto something because of all the calendar apps, this widget app has become my daily driver. I click in and want to see a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153week view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on my full screen within the app, like some calendar apps have, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no option for it and then I remember\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a widget app! I have a week view under my month view taking up an entire screen but again, with multiple events on one day, the week view even cuts off quite a bit. The only things that could fix this, a) apple accepts full screen size widgets, making it possible to see most or all events in a month widget or b) Minical converts to a full fledged calendar app with a week view option within. Either way, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see an optimized week view because the Google calendar shows thinly sliced days that require scrolling forever and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you a good overview of your day. The horizontal time block method with days of the week down the left side is better, if they could fit an entire week in a screen by condensing it, it would help SO MICH to see the open parts of the day in comparison to the others. Anyway, love the app, wish it were not widget focused because the interface is better than most calendars. If you need incentive to add the week view I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll donate haha",
