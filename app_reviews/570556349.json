The only reason why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give it 5 stars is that just recently there is an issue that when you add an event on a date it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall on that date that you chose. It puts the event on the day before. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really frustrating to have to delete, re-add, and then put it on the day before the event just so that the even falls on the correct date. I hope this bug gets fix, otherwise this app is awesome!",

Jorte lets you adjust everything: the colors, fonts, background, wallpapers, icons, etc. You can adjust everything to truly make it the best fit for you. \n\nThey also offer way more icons than all the other calendar apps, and it is super easy to just add them to your calendar as an appointment or as a reminder. They come out with new icon packs regularly, and their icon packs truly are little works of art (many of them are designed by the amazing artist at HJ-Story). \n\nIn addition to offering tons of features, a high degree of flexibility, and super cute icons, Jorte has the best and nicest customer service. You can always reach out to them, and they even take into account wishes for future icon packs, which most apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think about doing.\n\nSo If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a calendar app, go with Jorte. I tried so many before I found Jorte and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the only one that truly checks all the boxes. LOVE my Jorte!",

Been using Jorte calendar exclusively for years and love it!  I have the free version and find it reliable and easy to use with great features.  Has the look of the old monthly pocket calendars I used to buy each year, but thanks to the jorte cloud, I never have to worry about loosing it.  And it seamlessly appears on any new devices I get. I use the task feature on it as well.  All I need to stay well organized, right at my fingertips and with pleasing aesthetics. This app makes my life easier, so my thanks to the developers!",

I even have my paydays hilighted a separate color!!! Jorte continues to make this app better & listens to our feedback. I've had two updates that made the app crash but Jorte fixed the bugs the very next day!!! I recommend syncing with google calendar for a backup. I've tried other apps. Only one can even remotely close, but way too complicated (Informant & $15 after a 7 day trial \u011f\u0178\u2018\ufffd\u011f\u0178\ufffd\u00bc no thanks). Jorte is 100x more user friendly!!!

The few problems i've noticed recently is that items deleted on my Ipad wont be deleted on my other devices, and the devices don't always automatically sync. Considering this free version is as reliable as it is, I'm very happy and will continue to use Jorte. I haven't upgraded to the paid version because there are no features that I need, but wouldn't hesitate to pay for new features that I'd benefit from.",

        "content": "The big thing that is preventing me from giving this 4 1/2-5 stars is lag time. It's not just the current update it's been like that for awhile. Anytime I press on things, like if I want to see what's on for today so I click today's date, and it takes about 5 seconds to load to what I have shown on the schedule for that date. Also if I click the lower left word to bring up the left side menu, it also take about 5 sec to bring it up. Nothing shows up right away when clicked. I wonder if others r having this issue? My software is up to date so hopefully u guys are reading this and can get a fix for this?",
