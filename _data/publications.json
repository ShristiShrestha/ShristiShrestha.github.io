         "problem": "Finding an app that meets specific user criteria is difficult because the current `one-size-fits-all` 5-star rating system in app stores fails to capture domain-specific needs. This forces users to spend significant mental effort scrolling through thousands of unstructured reviews to locate relevant information.",
        "solution": "We developed an automated, unsupervised pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate `Rate Features` from long, unstructured app reviews. Rate features are neutral, domain-specific, concise summaries  (2-3 words) of the reviews.",
